## JSON Server

- In this section, I had time to dive into JSON server, to understand how they work and how we can connect them to a React project. JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is the format websites use to communicate.

- The responsibility of a frontend developer is to manage data in their frontend applications. You will need to be able to retrieve data from an API, manipulate it, and then render it.

## Installation

- To use JSON server for creating a fake API to work with a React application, you can install it either locally or globally in your development environment.

```bash
# install globally
npm install -g json-server

# install locally
npm install json-server
```

- Create a JSON file. It's recommended to create a folder called data, and within that folder, create your JSON files for working with requests.

```sh
# create folder
mkdir data

# navigate into the folder
cd data

# create a JSON file
touch blogs.json
```

- Create data to work with blogs, but you can choose any data you want to work on in this project.

```json
{
    "blogs":[
        {
            "title": "Inconsistent Code Quality Standards",
            "body": "Developers working on collaborative projects may face difficulties in maintaining consistent code quality standards within the team.",
            "author": "Alpha X",
            "id":1,
            "category":"career"
        },
        {
            "title": "Balancing Work and Learning",
            "body": "Professionals seeking to upskill may find it challenging to balance their current work responsibilities with the time required for continuous learning.",
            "author": "Alpha X",
            "id":2,
            "category":"career"
        },
        {
            "title": "Getting started with Go",
            "body": "Before diving into Go, you need to configure your text editor.",
            "author": "NjoxPy",
            "id":3,
            "category":"web development"
        },
        {
            "title": "Imposter Syndrome",
            "body": "Many individuals, especially those new to the tech industry, may battle imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate or questioning their skills and qualifications.",
            "author": "NjoxPy",
            "id":4,
            "category":"career"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Start Server

- Since you have installed JSON server, now it's time to start your server to see how it works.

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

- This will run on localhost:3000. Since your React application is also working on port 3000, you can choose to change the port using the --port flag.

```sh
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
```

- JSON Server will automatically generate RESTful endpoints based on the data you defined in your JSON file. If you have a JSON file with an array of "blogs", an endpoint will be automatically generated by the JSON Server.
