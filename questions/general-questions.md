- Why is it considered better practice to use const or let over var in modern JavaScript?
- How does variable hoisting differ between var and let/const?
- Can you reassign a value to a variable declared with const? Why or why not?
- When should you choose let over const?

## Practical Questions

- Write a code snippet demonstrating the use of let in a for loop.
- Create a function that uses const to declare a constant variable inside the function body.
- Show how you would use var to declare a global variable and then modify its value inside a function.
- Use let to declare a variable and then update its value in a nested block scope.
- Write a short program that showcases the block scoping of let and const within an if statement.

## Objects

Logical Questions:

- What is an object literal in JavaScript?
- How do you access properties of an object?
- Explain the difference between dot notation and bracket notation when accessing object properties.
- Can objects in JavaScript have methods? If so, how are they defined?
- How do you create a shallow copy of an object?

Practical Questions:

- Create an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year.
- Add a method start() to the car object that logs "The car is starting."
- Access and log the model property of the car object using dot notation.
- Use bracket notation to dynamically access a property of the car object based on user input.
- Write a function that takes an object and returns a new object with all the original properties, plus a new property color.
