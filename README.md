Welcome to my React ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) Learning Journey Log! This repository serves as a documentation of my learning adventure with React.js. Here, you'll find a collection of code snippets, tutorials, projects, and notes as I explore the world of building dynamic and interactive web applications with React.

## About

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. Through this journey log, I aim to gain proficiency in React fundamentals, dive into state management with React Hooks, explore advanced topics like context and routing, and ultimately build real-world projects to apply my learning.

## Tools Used

- **Text Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Node.js and npm:** For managing dependencies and running React apps
- **React Developer Tools:** Browser extension for inspecting React component hierarchies
- **Git:** Version control system for managing code changes
- **Create React App:** A comfortable environment for creating React applications with no build configuration
